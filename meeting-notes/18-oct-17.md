## Fake News System
The objective will be to tackle clickbait. The incentive structure for online news outlets is related to the number of "clicks" a given news piece has. For that reason there is an incentive to create missleading and "catchy" titles, to draw readers into the website.
By using an architecture based on blockchain and **verifiable claims**, a highly decentralized clickbait system can be built.

> A link to the architecture will be added as soon as the document is ready.
