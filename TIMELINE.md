# Timeline

## September

#### Week - Sep 11

- [ ] Create _Wizard of Oz Prototype_ that:
  - [ ] Exposes s RESTful API with
 ¬† ¬†- [x] .publishCert
    - [ ] .verifyCert 
    - [ ] .revokeCert
  - [x] A simple webpage that uses this service
  - Notes: Use an in memory database. Follow the Blockcerts format
- [x] Record a demo of this Demo

#### Week - Sep 18

This week's focus is to get the first integration between hypercerts-daemon, IPFS and blockcerts

- [x] Use IPFS to store an example Cert that has already been published through blockcerts
- [x] .verifyCert by Hash or by JSON of Certs available in the Chain.
- [x] Show a demo of publishing cert in one machine and verifying in the other (then revoke and verify again)
- [x] Complete (relevant) remaining Core Nodeschool courses.
- [x] Complete Promises Nodeschool course
- [ ] ~~Start Survey Research about the ideal Verifiable Claims System~~ Moved to next week.

#### Week - Sep 25
The week's focus is to implement a client based certificate revocation mechanism. The current version requires manual handling of files in order to revoke a certificate. That is to be changed. So, continuing with the Ethereum SC being mocked by a local file, accomplish the following:
- [x] Create method for Client to append/retract proofs to the proofs file and add that file to IPFS
- [ ] Create method allow the client to alter the ethereum mock file, by updating it with the new proofs file.
- [ ] Configure the Turbina server to run both IPFS daemon and Nodejs app as a service permanentely (for system testing with several clients)
- [ ] Improve documentation on how to deploy the application (instalation guide, basically)
- [ ] Update the RWOT whitepaper to be in accordance with the application.
- [x] Create github issue to foment discussion on how certain revocation details should be handled.
- [ ] _from last week_ Start Survey Research about the ideal Verifiable Claims System

#### Week - Oct 09
#### Week - Oct 16

- [ ] ~~End Survey Research about the ideal Verifiable Claims System~~
- [ ] Study VC specification and understand how revocation can be implemented.
- [ ] **Clickbait:** Search for good news articles to test the system against, currently the news topic to research is Bitcoin block size.

    - Remove the current readme.md
    - Work on new illustrations

#### Week - Oct 23
